                                <p> We want to inform you that whenever you use our Service, in a case of
                                    an error in the app we collect data and information (through third party products) on your phone
                                    called Log Data. This Log Data may include information such as your device name, operating system version, 
                                    the configuration of the app when utilizing our Service, the time and date of your use of the Service, and other statistics.

                                <p>
                                  Log Data is only used to understand how a crash occurred and how to fix it. It is not sent to other third-party services.
                                  Log Data is only a snapshot of VNDBA's state at the time a crash occurs: it is not collected, nor is it updated when VNDBA doesn't crash.
                                  Log Data may include but is not limited to:
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>Your username on VNDB.org</li>
                                        <li>The number of VNs you have in your VN list : this helps us determine the size of your account, which may be a factor of crash.</li>
                                        <li>Your preferences within the app.</li>
                                    </ul>
                                </p>
                                <p><strong>Cookies</strong></p>
                                <p>Cookies are files with a small amount of data that are commonly used as anonymous unique identifiers.
                                    These are sent to your browser from the websites that you visit and are stored on your device's internal
                                    memory.
                                </p>
                                <p>This Service does not use these “cookies” explicitly. However, the app may open links to external websites,
                                  which may use cookies to collect information and improve their services.

                                <p><strong>Links to Other Sites</strong></p>
                                <p>This Service may contain links to other sites. If you click on a third-party link, you will be directed
                                    to that site. Note that these external sites are not operated by us. Therefore, we strongly

                                <p>These Services do not address anyone under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect
                                    personally identifiable information from children under 13. In the case we discover that a child
                                    under 13 has provided us with personal information, we immediately delete this from
                                    our servers. If you are a parent or guardian and you are aware that your child has provided us with personal

                                <p>By downloading or using the app, these terms will automatically apply to you – you should make sure
                                    therefore that you read them carefully before using the app. VNDBA is licensed under GNU GPL v3.0, whose
                                    terms and conditions <a href="https://gitlab.com/thomas.herbeth/VNDB-Android/blob/master/LICENSE.md">can be read here</a>.</p>

                                <p>As a client for VNDB.org, VNDBA extensively uses VNDB.org's services. Thus, please be aware that VNDBA is not affiliated
                                  in any way with VNDB.org. We have no control over and assume no responsibility for the content provided by VNDB.org. Also,
                                  the Service is provided as is, and should not be liable for any interruption or discontinuation of VNDB.org's services.

                                <p>Booboot Apps is committed to ensuring that the app is as useful and efficient as possible. For
                                    that reason, we reserve the right to make changes to the app or to charge for its services, at any time
                                    and for any reason. We will never charge you for the app or its services without making it very clear
                                    to you exactly what you’re paying for.</p>

                                <p>The VNDBA app stores and processes personal data that you have provided to us, in order to provide
                                    our Service. It’s your responsibility to keep your phone and access to the app secure. We therefore
                                    recommend that you do not jailbreak or root your phone, which is the process of removing software restrictions
                                    and limitations imposed by the official operating system of your device. It could make your phone vulnerable
                                    to malware/viruses/malicious programs, compromise your phone’s security features and it could mean that
                                    the VNDBA app won’t work properly or at all. </p>

                                <p>You should be aware that there are certain things that Booboot Apps will not take responsibility
                                    for. Certain functions of the app will require the app to have an active internet connection. The connection
                                    can be Wi-Fi, or provided by your mobile network provider, but Booboot Apps cannot take responsibility
                                    for the app not working at full functionality if you don’t have access to Wi-Fi, and you don’t have any
                                    of your data allowance left.
                                    <p>

                                        <p>If you’re using the app outside of an area with Wi-Fi, you should remember that your terms of the
                                            agreement with your mobile network provider will still apply. As a result, you may be charged by
                                            your mobile provider for the cost of data for the duration of the connection while accessing the
                                            app, or other third party charges. In using the app, you’re accepting responsibility for any such
                                            charges, including roaming data charges if you use the app outside of your home territory (i.e. region
                                            or country) without turning off data roaming. If you are not the bill payer for the device on which
                                            you’re using the app, please be aware that we assume that you have received permission from the bill
                                            payer for using the app.</p>

                                        <p>Along the same lines, Booboot Apps cannot always take responsibility for the way you use
                                            the app i.e. You need to make sure that your device stays charged – if it runs out of battery and
                                            you can’t turn it on to avail the Service, Booboot Apps cannot accept responsibility.</p>

                                        <p>With respect to Booboot Apps’s responsibility for your use of the app, when you’re using
                                            the app, it’s important to bear in mind that although we endeavour to ensure that it is updated and
                                            correct at all times, we do rely on third parties to provide information to us so that we can make
                                            it available to you. Booboot Apps accepts no liability for any loss, direct or indirect,
                                            you experience as a result of relying wholly on this functionality of the app.</p>

                                        <p>At some point, we may wish to update the app. The app is currently available on Android – the
                                            requirements for system (and for any additional systems we decide to extend the availability
                                            of the app to) may change, and you’ll need to download the updates if you want to keep using the
                                            app. Booboot Apps does not promise that it will always update the app so that it is relevant
                                            to you and/or works with the Android version that you have installed on your device. However,
                                            you promise to always accept updates to the application when offered to you. We may also wish to
                                            stop providing the app, and may terminate use of it at any time without giving notice of termination
                                            to you. Unless we tell you otherwise, upon any termination, (a) the rights and licenses granted to
                                            you in these terms will end; (b) you must stop using the app, and (if needed) delete it from your
                                            device.
